Description: High-level library for managing Debian package information
 The library defines a very minimal framework in which many sources of data
 about Debian packages can be implemented and queried together.
 .
 The library includes four data sources:
 .
  * APT: access the APT database
  * Debtags: access the Debtags tag information
  * Popcon: access Popcon package scores
  * The Xapian index built by apt-xapian-index
 .
 This is the development library.
