DESCRIPTION end
|\fBept-cache\fP is a high-level tool to access package information.
|.P
|It can currently search and display data from four sources: the APT database,
|the Debtags tag information, Popcon package scores and a fast Xapian-based full
|text index on package descriptions.
|.P
|If the Xapian data source is enabled, output results are by default sorted by
|relevance order, with the best results first.  If you are seeing strange
|results in the output, rerun the search with the \-\-full switch and look at
|the Search\-Score headers.
