Frequently Asked Questions for ept-cache
========================================

Q: How does ept-cache related work?
A: The 'related' function of ept-cache relies on the Xapian index and works
   like this:
    1. Look up the Xapian records for all the package names given in the
       command line;
    2. Fetch all the tokens indexed for all the packages given, and build an OR
       query with all those tokens;
    3. Output the results of the query.

Q: How come the results of ept-cache seem to be in random order?
A: By default, ept-cache gives results in decreasing order of relevance.
   Simply put, it gives the best results first.

   ept-cache, however, allows query results to degenerate into less and less
   approximate matches, and sometimes this leads to a point where results start
   to look random.

   If you want to have an idea of what is going on, use the --debug option to
   see how the quality cutoff point is computed, then the --full option to
   see the Search-Score: values.  You can also use --cutoff to set a higher
   quality cutoff value (default is to show results that are at least 50% as
   good as the top result).
